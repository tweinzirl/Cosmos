Python Cosmology Calculator

Looking for a cosmology package ... for Python? Cosmos calculates useful cosmological quantities (e.g. Hubble distance and Hubble time, luminosity and angular diameter distances, distance modulus, comoving volume, lookback time) from within your own Python code. 

Dependencies are NumPy (numpy.scipy.org) and PyGSL (pygsl.sourceforge.net).
